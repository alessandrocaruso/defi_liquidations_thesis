# DeFi Protocols for Loanable Funds: A Statistical Approach towards Liquidation

## Alessandro Caruso, MSc in Data Science - Bocconi University - October 2022

# General Information:

This repository contains the code for my Master Thesis, where I study the liquidation phenomena in DeFi protocols by directly querying data from the Ethereum Blockchain.
Three protocols for Loanable Funds are analyzed, namely Aave, Compound and MakerDAO.

The liquidation problem is tackled both from an inferential and predictive perspective, where on one hand the author tries to estimate the impact of each protocol on the probability of being liquidated, and on the other aiming at proposing a strategy for a liquidation bot based on statistical evidence.

## Data Visualization

The following dashboards contain summarized information related to the selected protocols, where SQL queries have been written for each of these.
- Aave: https://dune.com/nomade/aave-thesis-final
- MakerDAO: https://dune.com/nomade/makerdao-thesis-final
- Compound: https://dune.com/nomade/compound-thesis-final
- Comparison of PLFs: https://dune.com/nomade/comparison-plfs-thesis-final

Extraction of data has been based on the work of https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook and queries can be found in the plfs folder.
